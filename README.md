##✈️ Customer Segmentation Project – Travel Booking Platform
This repository contains the full workflow for a customer segmentation project for a travel-booking company. The main objective is to analyze user behavior, segment customers into meaningful groups using machine learning, and provide actionable business recommendations.

##📌 Project Overview

The project performs an end-to-end customer analysis using behavioral, transactional, and demographic features. After cleaning, engineering, and preprocessing customer data, K-Means clustering is applied to segment users into three distinct customer groups.
